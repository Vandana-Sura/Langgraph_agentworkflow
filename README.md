This project implements an agentic workflow using LangGraph and a Streamlit interface for interactive user queries. The workflow takes a complex query, splits it into manageable sub-tasks using a PlanAgent, and solves each sub-task with the help of a ToolAgent. The system iteratively refines the tasks by modifying, adding, or deleting them based on feedback, ensuring accurate results through a feedback loop and reflection process.
The goal is to create an intelligent pipeline where users can input complex queries (such as legal research questions), and the system automatically breaks them down and solves them step-by-step. The final refined results are displayed back to the user in the Streamlit interface.
Technologies used include LangGraph to structure agent interactions, Streamlit for the user interface, and Python for the backend logic. The project can be set up by cloning the repository, installing the dependencies, and running the Streamlit app. The modular structure allows for future expansion, such as adding new tools, enhancing feedback mechanisms, and improving the language model integrations.
